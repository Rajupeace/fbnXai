# 🎓 Student Dashboard 2.2 - Professional Polish

The Student Dashboard is now fully rebranded and professionally polished.

## ✨ Latest Enhancements

### 1. 🖼️ Clean & Branded Header
- **Rebranded:** The PULSE widget now displays **"FRIENDLY NOTEBOOK"** and **"ACADEMIC HEALTH"**.
- **Date/Time Display:** A professional digital clock and date display is aligned perfectly to the top-right corner.
- **Removed:** Search bar (as requested) and old static stats.

### 2. 🧠 Focus Mode & Layouts
- **Universal Notifications:** Real-time system alerts are now integrated universally.
- **Deep Work Focus Mode:** Available in the Study Tools widget (bottom-left).
- **Competency Radar:** A professional "Skills Matrix" chart in the sidebar.

### 3. 🛠️ Bug Fixes
- **Layout:** Fixed right-edge overflow issues on all screen sizes.
- **Alignment:** Corrected header element positioning.
- **Integration:** Reconnected Labs Schedule (via toggle in Schedule view).

### 4. 🔧 Backend Optimizations
- **Data Call Fix:** Improved the `Faculty` teaching query to handle case-insensitive branch names and string/number mismatches for Year. This ensures the "Mentor Circle" always loads correct data.

### 5. 🔄 Attendance Loop Verified
- **End-to-End:** Verified that Faculty submissions via `/api/attendance` correctly update:
    1. **Student Data** (Overall stats).
    2. **Enrollment Records** (Subject-wise stats).
    3. **Student Profile** (Global stats).
- **Result:** Student Dashboard reflects real-time attendance changes instantly.

## 🚀 How to PUSH
Sync your polished dashboard to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
